	<h1>Welcome to my site at its WORST
	</h1>
		<h2>This is NOT the time to visit my site.  It doesn't even have any CSS.  You should come back another time in the future.  It will only be getting better.  But I can assure you, right now, you will have a terrible experience on my site.

<br>
		<p>My site will be a lot of things but one thing it is <strong>NOT</strong> right now is anything.  By choosing to be here right now, you are choosing to waste your time.  Below is a list of my favorite sports <strong>in order</strong> through pictures.  Below that is a list of toys I would like to own soon to be accompanied by a very safe area <em>powered by Stripe</em> to donate money to my needs.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><img src="images/hockey.jpg" alt="hockey"></li>
				<li><img src="images/snowboarding.jpg" alt="snowboarding"></li>
				<li><img src="images/racing.jpg" alt="racing"></li>
			</ol>
		<br>
		<p>Below are toys that I absolutely need soon</p>
			<ul>
				<li>motorcycle</li>
				<li>jet-surf gas-powered wakeboard</li>
				<li>electric skateboard</li>
				<li>'69 Camaro</li>
			</ul>
<br>
		<p>I need to have all of these toys to function so please fill out the form in the footer that looks nothing like one below.  Do this as if the form actually worked as practice for donating in the future when it does.  Please nothing below $20 and suggested is $200 if you don't know me and skies the limit if you do.  Thanks.</p>

		<p>The site I chose to investigate is the Foo Fighters web page.  The site is about them like mine is about me.  That's where the similarities seem to cease.  The page has very detailed CSS whereas mine has none.  There is a lot of block-level elements but they all have so much detail within them! Here's a link to their band. <a href="http://www.saintceciliaep.com/">LINK</a></p>
