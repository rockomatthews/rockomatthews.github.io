	<h1>Welcome to my site at its WORST
	</h1>
		<h2>This is NOT the time to visit my site.  It doesn't even have any CSS.  You should come back another time in the future.  It will only be getting better.  But I can assure you, right now, you will have a terrible experience on my site.

		<p>My site will be a lot of things but one thing it is <strong>NOT</strong> right now is anything.  By choosing to be here right now, you are choosing to waste your time.  Above everything is a picture of me.  Below is a list of my favorite sports <strong>in order</strong> through pictures.  Below that is a list of toys I would like to own soon to be accompanied by a very safe area <em>powered by Stripe</em> to donate money to my needs.</p>
